\paragraph{\underline{Cluster algorithm}\\}
Function that applies a clustering technique to the data (possibly both original image and extracted features\g{}).

\paragraph{\underline{Data}\\}
An image that have to be analyzed.

\paragraph{\underline{Dataset}\\}
Logic abstraction of an analysis. Consists of a group of Subjects\g{} and a Protocol\g{} that performs on it. Each Subject\g{} of the group will may be processed by the Protocol\g{} during an analysis.

\paragraph{\underline{Feature}\\}
Information extracted from the image, not present originally. A feature could visually underline, for example, a particular type of tissue.

\paragraph{\underline{Feature extractor}\\}
Function that calculates a feature\g{} of interest from the data\g{}

\paragraph{\underline{Mask}\\}
A binary image which is used to delimit the region of interest of a data\g{} that have to be analyzed. The data\g{} elements whose corresponding mask\g{} values are zero, are discarded from the analysis.

\paragraph{\underline{Protocol}\\}
Combination of a set of feature extractors\g{} (from 0 to N) and one clustering algorithm\g{} (from 0 to 1). A Protocol is associated to one or more Datasets\g{}.
