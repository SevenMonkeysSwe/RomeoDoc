\section{Set up analysis}
\label{setupanalysis}
Once Romeo is properly installed on the computer, you can start to fill it with your data, in order to perform an analysis. Before this, you need to import your images and eventually their relative mask, create your group of Subjects\g{}, your Protocols\g{} and your Datasets\g{}. Please read this section to get more information about these operations.\\
This chapter contains the following sections:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{About Subjects}
\item \textbf{About groups of Subjects}
\item \textbf{About Protocols}
\item \textbf{About Datasets}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{About Subjects}
\label{aboutsubject}
This section contains the procedures to create and manage the Subjects\g{}.

\subsubsection{Create Subject}
\label{createsubject}
The creation of a new Subject\g{} is assigned to the Subjects\g{} creation window.\\
From the main window of Romeo, select the \textit{New Subject} button or choose the right one in the toolbar (see \ref{environment}). The Subjects\g{} creation window (fig. \ref{createsubjectimg}), is composed of one panel containing a form in which the user have to insert the information about the \subject{}. In any moment, the user can go back to the main window by selecting the \textit{Back} button.

\label{createsubjectimg}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\\To create a new Subject\g{}, follow these instructions:
\begin{itemize}
\item From the Subjects\g{} creation window, type a unique name in the \textit{Subject Name} field. That name will be the name of the \subject{};
\item Select the image type that will be imported in the Subject\g{}. The type could be: 2D, 3D, 2D-t, 3D-t;
\item Select the image to import by selecting the \textit{Search} button next to the \textit{Add File} field and navigating the file system;
\item Import a mask\g{} selecting it by clicking the \textit{Search} button next to the \textit{Add Mask} field and navigating the file system, if necessary;
\item Confirm the operation by clicking the \textit{Save} button. Romeo will report an error message if not all the required fields are fulfilled or the name chosen for the Subject\g{} is already present in Romeo.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Visualize Subjects}
\label{visulizesubjects}
The visualization of the details of a \subject{} is assigned to the Subject\g{} visualization window.\\
From the main window of Romeo, select the \textit{View Subjects} button or choose the right one in the toolbar (see \ref{environment}). The Subject\g{} visualization window (fig. \ref{visualizesubjectimg}), is composed of two panels. The left one contains the list of Subjects\g{} stored in Romeo, ordered by creation data (by default, from the oldest one, to the newest). For each Subject\g{} it is specified:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Name:} the name of the Subject\g{};
\item \textbf{Type:} the type of the Subject\g{} (2D, 3D, 2D-t, 3D-t);
\item \textbf{Mask:} display \textit{yes} if a mask was associated to the image, \textit{no} otherwise;
\item \textbf{Creation date:} the date and time in which the Subject\g{} was created.
\end{itemize}
The right panel contains the details of the selected Subject\g{}. It shows a preview of the image associated to the \subject{} and the list of groups that include such \subject{}. In any moment, the user can go back to the main window by selecting the \textit{Back} button.
